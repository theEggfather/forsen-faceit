# forsen-faceit
A website that tracks the current Faceit CSGO match of the twitch streamer Forsen.

The site is written in python using flask and related modules. Reasons for python are :
1) this evolved from a script (forsan.py) I used to prepare my stat spams
2) I already knew python and didnt care enough to learn a more solid framework/language.

I know the code is shitty, any and all recommendations are welcome.
